## To Run

  - pre-requisite
  
      Have nodejs, npm, .net core ... installed
      
      
  - Command to run the app : "dotnet run" inside WebUI folder
  
  After that app should be available at http://localhost:5002/
  
  ⚡ : Give time to Angular app to be ready: sometimes the .net core api is ready before the angular app becomes available
  
  
  
  ## Improvements to make for production ready version
  
    - Change database: for this POC, SQLite is embedded.
    - Add integration tests
    - Improve user interface
    - Configure degree of parallelism depending on computer characteristics
    - Make the app asynchronous depending on potential usage
    - Fix reviews' sort by columns feature
    - Get number of actually downloaded reviews per request
    - Possibilty to replay an indexation request in one click

## PS:

I do believe that code with well-named variables and methods does not need comments!
